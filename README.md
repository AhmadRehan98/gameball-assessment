## Database

I used Mongo for my convenience.
Since I used a non-sql DB, I added all data fields in one collection, since there shouldn't be a benefit in normalizing the data(?). 
I've also dropped the data related to number of items and just assumed all items are available in unlimited quantity.
But if were to use a SQL DB, this would be my schema:
